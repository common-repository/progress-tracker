A simple tool that allows people to easily track their progress through your site.

== Description ==
Allow your users/students to keep track of their progression in your site. They can click a 'Completed' button on pages where tracking is activated which gives them a visual guide when thry return to the site as to where they left off. Also provides handy 'Next' and 'Back' buttons within a set of sub pages (think topic pages), as well as a 'quick jump' list so they can quickly visit any page in that topic. All of this can be customised.

**How to Use** 
- When creating a new page or editing an existing one, tick the 'Enable tracking' option in the Page attributes settings.
- Any sub pages created with this as a parent will be tracked. A mini menu indicating current progression is shown at the top of the parent page.
- This only works for logged in users!

**Plugin Options**
- Location of the next / back buttons (top or bottom)
